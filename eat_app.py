# Building Energy Analysis App

This app doesn't do anything yet. Edit the code to make it do stuff. Some functionality from the trend data app is
left in as an example. Take a look at the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/) and the 
[Streamlit gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery) for inspiration.

Here's an example of working with uploaded files. Upload a .csv file with timestamps in the first column and trend data 
in the remaining columns."""

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file")

st.write("Here's an example of a button. Click 'See example'.")

if st.button('See example'):
    df = pd.read_csv(example_data_path + random.choice(os.listdir(example_data_path)))  # pick a random example file
    if df.columns[0] == 'Unnamed: 0':
        df.drop(df.columns[0], axis=1, inplace=True)  # !!! drop the first column of data so timestamps are in column
    fig = plot_time(df)

    """
    ### Raw Data (example):

    Uploaded file should be in .csv format with timestamps in the first column and trend data in the remaining 
    columns. This app supports a variety of timestamp formats, but the format should be consistent for all timestamps 
    in the uploaded file. Trend data columns should have meaningful titles. For best practice, use *lowercase*, 
    *lowercase_with_underscores*, or *camelCase*

    Click on point names in the legend to make them visible.
